The link to the JSON file is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jBuu1xs8klMIzno0K56Uqhzu-QCWfXWD?usp=drive_link

I could not find another way of uploading the data I scraped here on GitHub. You will have to either:

1) Request access to the drive and I will allow it.

2) Run the Jupyter Notebook completely (including the scraping part), so that it saves the JSON file to be used automatically in your directory (this option may take around 10 minutes).
